    "My greatest natural strength is my self awareness and my flexibilty. Explanation ~ For my flexibility, through my econometrics / other programming courses, I have learned how to find resources online to help me acheive a task. I feel that I can learn just about anything on my own. Environment sensitive.\n",

    "ability to listen and ask questions. I have found that inefficiency can very easily stem from not fully understanding the objective that needs to be reached. Being precise about the objective, whether short term or long term easily sets up the next tasks for completion. \n",

    "\n",
    "My greatest weakness tends to be that I am not a natural self-starter. I think that my self awareness comes at a cost in that I get bogged down by doing a lot of thinking which leads me to get too focused on specific details of a project or just overwhelmed.\n",

    "Generally, I am most confident with Econometric research methods. I am beginning to be more confident with an Analytical PDE approach as well. It will be useful to see where these two different approaches intersect."
